# Gameplay
The game follows the rules of the traditional game with two players playing against each other. If one of them wins, they get a score point and the two swap who goes first. If the game is bound to end up in a tie, then it ends prematurely and neither player gets a point  
  
Reseting the game resets the score and returns users to the main game menu
  
Two game modes are available:
| Player vs Player | Player vs AI |
| :--: | :--: |
| Two players play simultaneuosly, taking turns to place their figures, trying to outsmart each other | One player plays against an unbeatable bot, utilizing the ***minimax*** algorithm, in an endless spiral of ties |
